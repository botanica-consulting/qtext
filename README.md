# qtext
This repository contains a Python script to accompany our blog post - Decoding the 90s: [A Journey into Reverse Engineering and Cryptography in Early Software Development](https://www.botanica.software/post/decoding-the-90s).

In it, we explain how QText implemented encryption and how we were able to break it. In this repository, you will find a Python script that allows you to decrypt your own documents. 

Please use at your own risk. Feel free to contribute and send us a pull request if you found anything interesting you want to add.
